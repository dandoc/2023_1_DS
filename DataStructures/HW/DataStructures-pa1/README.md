# Programming Assignment 1. SLIST: Sorted List with Generic Doubly Linked List

### Attributes
* Type: Individual work (you cannot collaborate with other students)
* Due date: 9 PM, 31 Mar (Fri) 2023 KST
* Rules: Only the C programming language reference, the earlier lab results, and the main textbook are allowed for your reference in doinig this homework. You are not allowed to see existing source code and to use other programming assistant tools; You must write down all source code by yourself.

### Description

This assignment asks you to implement a doubly linked list that can contain data elemetns of an arbitrary type (generic list) in
certain order (sorted list).

Read the header file `slist.h` and the test code `main.c` carefully to understsand the expected behaviors of the `slist` functions. And then write down the bodies of the functions in `slist.c`. Note that you are not allowed to modify `slist.h` and `main.c`.

One important requirement is that you must write `slist_merge` such that its time complexity must be a Big-O of the total number of elements.

Submit `gdlist.c` to HDLMS by 9 PM, 31 Mar (Fri). No late submission will be accepted.

Your results will be evaluated by test cases (i.e., other versions of `main.c`), and also you will get interview exam with the resulting code.
